# N-Back

Participants are asked to repsond by pressing a button when the currently 
highlighted square (one of nine) is the same as the one highlighted N trials 
back. N will start at 1, then be 2 and finally 3.

This tests short-term spatial memory. Recorded are reaction times and whether 
or not the response was correct.

The participant data has been stripped from this repository. This version of the project is meant for use as the author's archival version. If you are using any of this repository's resources, at the least, please credit Andrew Vu, programmer in the Sensorimotor Control Lab at York University.
