# N-Back

Participants are asked to repsond by pressing a button when the currently 
highlighted square (one of nine) is the same as the one highlighted N trials 
back. N will start at 1, then be 2 and finally 3.

This tests short-term spatial memory. Recorded are reaction times and whether 
or not the response was correct.
